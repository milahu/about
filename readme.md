## life

TODO autobiography



### 2009



#### university

what: Electrical Engineering and Information Technology

where: TUM = Technical University of Munich

how long: 2 semesters, then i gave up, because it was too theoretical,
and the students were fully responsible to find actual work in the industry,
but i was lazy as shit, so i didnt look for jobs,
and after 2 semesters, "ugly" subjects like "material science" were added,
which just stupid learning of facts, no system of derivations like math or physics...
probably i should have studied at the FH Rosenheim,
where they have "Duales Studium" = every semester you both study and work,
probably then i would have a degree and a well-paid job now...
